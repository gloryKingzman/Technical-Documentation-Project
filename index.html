            <h2>How to Read This Guide</h2>
            <p>In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.</p>
            <p>This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can access the navigation by pressing the button
                in the bottom right corner of your screen.</p>

            <h2>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2>
            <p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to check your knowledge level and enable you to
                follow along this guide without getting lost. It might take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>

            <h2>What you should already know</h2>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="introducing_jsx">
            <header class="section-header">Introducing JSX</header>
            <p>Consider this variable declaration:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>const element = h1 Hello, world! /h1;</code>
            </div>

            <p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.</p>
            <p>t is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.</p>
            <p>
                JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.</p>
            <h2>Why JSX</h2>
            <p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</p>
            <p>Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section,
                but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise.</p>
            <p>React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages</p>
            <p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!
            </p>
            <h2>Embedding Expressions in JSX</h2>

            <p>In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:</p>
            <div class="code"> <code>const name = 'Josh Perez';
                                const element = >h1< Hello, {name}</h1Hello,>;
                                
                                ReactDOM.render(
                                  element,
                                  document.getElementById('root'));
                                </code>
            </div>
            <p>You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions. In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function,
                formatName(user), into an h1 element.</p>
            <div class="code">
                <code> function 
                    formatName(user) 
                                    return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
                                  }const user = {
                                    firstName: 'Harper',
                                    lastName: 'Perez'
                                  
                                  
                                  const element = (
                                    h1
                                        
                                      Hello, {formatName(user)}
                                    h1
                                  )
                                  
                                  ReactDOM.render(
                                    element,
                                    document.getElementById('root')
                                  )
                 </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.

            <header class="section-header">Rendering Elements</header>
            <p class="byline">Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.</p>
            <p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>
            <div><code>const element = h1 Hello, world h1;</code></div>
            <p>Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.
            </p>
            <h2>Rendering an Element into the DOM</h2>
            <p>Let’s say there is a div somewhere in your HTML file:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>div id="root"div </code></div>

            <p>We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated
                root DOM nodes as you like. To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():</p>
            <div class="code"><code>const element = h1 Hello, world h1;
                        ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));</code></div>
            <p>It displays “Hello, world” on the page.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="components_and_props">
            <header class="section-header">Components and Props</header>
            <p class="byline">Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here.</p>
            <p>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>
            <h2>Function and Class Components</h2>
            <p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>function Welcome(props) {
                    return h1 Hello, {props.name}/h1;
                  }</code></div>
            <p>This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript
                functions.
            </p>
            <p>You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>class Welcome extends React.Component {
                    render() {
                      return h1 Hello, {this.props.name}h1;
                    }
                  }</code></div>
            <p>The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.</p>
            <p>Classes have some additional features that we will discuss in the next sections. Until then, we will use function components for their conciseness.</p>
            <h2>Rendering a Component</h2>
            <p>Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>const element = div;</code></div>
            <p>However, elements can also represent user-defined components:</p>
            <div class="code"><code>const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;</code></div>
            <p>When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”</p>
